This is the project repository for ExpOCR!

Description:

As students, we usually go for outings/restaurants/grocery shopping with friends and have to split the share. Also, with limited earnings, it is preferable to maintain our expense records and thus avoid splurging on unnecessary items. Currently, we have to use different apps for splitting expenses and maintaining our personal record, moreover, these apps do not do pattern mining to help us find trends and avoid frequent expenditure. We want to develop a new app (ExpOCR!) to track personal expenses, split the expenses, find trends in our expenses, and scan items from the bills. With OCR you can Snap, assign and done!

App:

It is an Android App. You can clone the project and run it in an IDE that supports android development. You can also generate APK to run it in an android phone.
